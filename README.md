## TOPIC
COVID/Economy/Unemployment Impact on NYC Housing Prices
### Reason 
* COVID and Housing Data is widely available for analysis
* Found housing rental data on Street Easy by neighborhoods, borough for last 10 years.
* Since the data is available in span of last 10 years, it will allow us to generate comparative analysis from pre COVID to COVID changes in housing rental market in NYC.
### Description - source of data
* We are planning to use three sources of data.
  * Unemployment Data
  * Income Data from IRS - https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-2018-zip-code-data-soi
  * Housing data - from Street Easy
* Database
  * pgAdmin
    * Table 1 - Housing Table
      * Housing feature1
      * Housing feature2
      * Housing feature3
      * zipcode
      * year
      * Housing Price
      NOTE: Housing features - #of bedrooms, sq ft etc.
     
     * Table 2 - Unemployment
        * zipcode
        * Year
        * number of people unemployed
      
     * Table 3 - Income
        * zipcode
        * Year
        * Avg Income (or could be median?)
      
### Questions we hope to answer

* How does unemployement affected housing prices?
* How does income impacts housing prices?
* On the side - we are also planning to have seperate impact analysis due to COVID if time permits. - # of COVID CASES by the Zipcode and housing prices.
